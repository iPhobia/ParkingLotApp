⚙️ Implementation Details
🧩 ParkingLotManager

Performs parking logic.

Provides information regarding:

The current state of the parking lot.

Total occupied spots.

Spots taken per vehicle type.

🧱 ParkingLotSpot

Base class for different types of parking spots.

Each spot type has a predefined number of available spots.

Keeps track of:

Available spots

Taken spots

Parked vehicles

Contains business logic to validate if a given vehicle can be parked in the chosen spot.

🚗 Vehicle

Base class for different types of vehicles.

Each vehicle type has a preconfigured amount of required spots.

🧠 Parking Rules & Assumptions
Vehicle Type	Can Park In	Spots Taken
Motorcycle	Any spot	1
Car	Regular or Large spot	1
Van	Large spot	3 (or equivalent of 3 regular spots)
⚠️ Faced Issues

Missing data: No information was given on how many spots each parking spot type should provide.
→ Based on “A van can park in a large spot, but it will take up 3 regular spots”, it is assumed:

Motorcycle and regular spots each hold 1 spot.

Large spot holds 3 spots.

Vehicle spot usage:
From the same rule, we assume:

Motorcycle and Car occupy 1 spot.

Van occupies 3 spots.

Van parking logic ambiguity:
It’s not explicitly defined how van parking should behave.
Therefore, it’s assumed that a parking spot can define how many spots it physically holds (e.g. large = 3, regular = 1, motorcycle = 1).

ParkedVehicles design:
ParkingLotSpot.ParkedVehicles is of type List<T>, which makes most sense for large spots.
However, changing it would violate the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP),
so keeping the same structure is considered acceptable.
